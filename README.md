# NG8-Material-Boilerplate

## Welcome to the boilerplate

My goal was to make something to kick-start someone on making an Angular 2-8 (this app is 8.3.0) with the latest Material Design without much prior knowledge.

The vast majority of the modules you will need are included and places in a TypeScript file called material.ts inside the demo-app/ folder. When you get started, it is a good idea to make your own copy of this folder and start your work there.

## Getting Started

### Overview

Like mentioned above, the demo-app/ folder contains most of the Angular Material components imported, but NOT used in any context yet. You can go to https://material.angular.io/components/categories and get copy-and-paste examples of the components.
